**[android_device_xiaomi_daisy<IconExtLink/>](https://github.com/JakeIsMeh/android_device_xiaomi_daisy)**<br>
*Note: Unfinished & Deprecated - Please use [33bca's<IconExtLink/>](https://github.com/33bca/android_device_xiaomi_daisy) or [Saksham033's<IconExtLink/>](https://github.com/Saksham033/device_xiaomi_daisy) device trees instead.*<br>
My device tree for the Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Codename: daisy_sprout) from when there was no development for it. This project followed AlaskanLinuxUser's fantastic [guide<IconExtLink/>](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJ9-cX1yE1nnhWBrZtuVz5YC2OPfQVVp) on developing a device tree from scratch.
<br>

**[cmdAnywhere<IconExtLink/>](https://github.com/JakeIsMeh/cmdAnywhere)**<br>
*Note: this project is probably done for the rest of time, as Powershell takes over the windows terminal market and batch files get depreciated.*<br/>
This is a script I made in Primary 5 and updated over the years. If you can run a batch file, you can run any command with this.
